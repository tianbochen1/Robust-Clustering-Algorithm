This repository is used to reproduce the results in paper: Chen et.al, A Robust Approach Using Functional Data Ranking (2020), Journal of Classification.   
Install the required R packages and run Main2.r to reproduce the simulation results. We also provided clustering results for EEG brain signals.  
File GCVsmoothing.r could estimate the spectrum of a timeseries using gamma-GCV methods. For details, see Ombao H C, Raz J A, Strawderman R L, et al. A Simple GCV Method of Span Selection for Periodigram Smoothing[R]. 1999.
