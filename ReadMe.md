This repository is used to reproduce the results in paper: Chen, T., Sun, Y., Euan, C., and Ombao, H., “Clustering Brain Signals: A Robust Approach Using Functional Data Ranking”, 2020, Accepted by Journal of Classification.     

Install the required R packages and run Main2.r to reproduce the simulation results. 

File GCVsmoothing.r provides:
1) Code for estimating the spectrum of a timeseries using gamma-GCV methods. See Ombao H C, Raz J A, Strawderman R L, et al. A Simple GCV Method of Span Selection for Periodigram Smoothing[R]. 1999.   
2) Code for robust clustering algorithms.
